React.createElement returns an object. 
When I render it is when it becomes HTML object. 
But react developer realized that React.createElement is becoming very clumsy. Hence JSX was introduced. 
JSX is not part of react. We can use react without JSX, but it just become very clumsy. 
Before react : HTML, Javascript files. We used to create skeleton in HTMl and logic in javascript. 
JSX is not HTML. Its not HTML inside javascript. Its HTML/XML like syntax. 
The code is written for both human and machine. If only machine then it would have been only 0 and 1. Hence always make the code very readable.
